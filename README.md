# Learning-Javascript
Learning JavaScript for an upcoming hackathon through the making of small projects. Here's a description of all the projects that I made:

Clicker: First javascript-related project. Super-easy because there's very minimal logic behind a program that increases and decreases a number. Although this project did introduce me to javascript basics such as the DOM and how to write/use functions.

Color-Changer: Slightly harder than the Clicker, but still does not require much logic. However, this project taught me how to access CSS information from JavaScript, which might be useful later on.

Tic-Tac-Toe: First real struggle for me. Much bigger than Clicker and Color-Changer (although I might have done this before Color-Changer. I forgot) because it's an actual game. For this, I decided to create a table for the board, but it was pretty hard styling it. I learned a decent amount of new CSS just from this project though. I also had a lot of bugs creating the logic of this game. I decided to use a 2D array to determine whether my win conditions were met or not, and sometimes the conditions would not work. But overall, still a pretty good project 

Calculator: This one was fun and challenging to make. I had gotten down the HTML and CSS part, but it took some time for me to get the logic for the JS down. After watching a few YouTubers code javascript games, including Calculator, I realized how inefficient and hard to follow my approach to the game is. Still learned a lot and I'm proud of myself for completing this.
