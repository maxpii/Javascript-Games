# Learning-Javascript
Learning javascript for an upcoming hackathon through the making of small projects. Here's a description of all the projects that I made:

Clicker: First javascript related project. Super-easy because there's very minimal logic behind a program that increases and decreases a number. Although this project did introduce me to javascript basics such as the DOM and how to write/use functions.

Color-Changer: Slightly harder than the Clicker, but still does not require much logic. However, this project taught me how to access CSS information from javascript, which might be useful later on.
